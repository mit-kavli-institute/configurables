# <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# <body>
#
# <footer>

# Type should be one of the following:
# - feat: A new feature (triggers minor version bump)
# - fix: A bug fix (triggers patch version bump)
# - docs: Documentation changes
# - style: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
# - refactor: Code refactoring without adding features or fixes
# - perf: Performance improvements
# - test: Adding or modifying tests
# - build: Changes to build system or dependencies
# - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
# - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files

# Scope is optional and can be anything specifying the place of the commit change.
# For example: core, parse, configurable, emission, etc.

# Subject should use imperative mood: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
# Don't capitalize first letter
# No period at the end

# Body should include motivation for the change and contrast with previous behavior

# Footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also 
# the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes
# Breaking Changes should start with "BREAKING CHANGE:" (triggers major version)

# Example:
# feat(parse): add support for yaml configuration files
#
# Add YAML parser to the parsing registry to support .yml and .yaml files.
# This allows users to use YAML format for their configuration files
# in addition to the existing INI format support.
#
# Closes #123
